          "selftext": "I believe we are about to see some big green candles for GME next week and here's why. If you look at the volume for GME is dried up quicker than your girlfriend can say stop. It fell off a cliff after we hit 255. The only way I can see the price dropping further is if the market goes down and GME keeps breaking low volume records. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sn21ot45kez71.png?width=2382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dcbc905ac09a62c8d2599031126be0f673af64e\n\nThe last time the volume and price action has matched this way was in September 2020 right when GME began its long term uptrend. I believe we are in the beginning stages of a similar long term uptrend where we are setting new floors as we go up.   \n\n\nAs you can see from the picture below the big green volume candle falls off a cliff and the volume keeps getting dryer and dryer until there's a Big Pop and massive buying volume comes in. I believe we are at this stage and this is why I believe we will have a massive green candle this week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfz5mp5hkez71.png?width=2406&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2f23c05715877acfa6fcb6278bfd0acd83788c3\n\nBullish Price Prediction - We hit 280 - 300 on Monday or Tuesday and get shorted back down to 220 where that will become our new floor.   \n\n\n190 New Floor Prediction - We keep dropping on lower and lower volume until we hit 190 Monday / Tuesday. Then this Massive Green Candle will show up Wednesday / Thursday  \n\n\nConsolidation Prediction - 200 is the new floor and we see low volume all week but with an uptrend and we test 220 again before the week ends.   \n\n\nVideo Overview - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozGqqTbgVOY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozGqqTbgVOY)",

          "selftext": "There are so many core issues that any sane person who plays just even an hour of the game notices, \n\nFrom rng bullets to the map design and even the pace of the game. The maps look pretty good, but they don't play very well at all.\n\nAlso 128 players and only 4 people per sqaud, without comms amongst squad leaders/squad members. There are so many core issues that are present in the game that it almost made the beta feel better to me imo. \n\nThese issues are apparent in the very first game that you join, leading me to think that the game testers just aren't doing their job? or maybe they are and Dice just didn't care?\n\nIt truly makes me wonder what happened in the 9+ months extra that Dice took to work on this game. \n\nI know there are a lot of rants on this subreddit and so I am using this as my way to vent because I am so frustrated with this title, my excitement for this launch was bold, that was such a mistake of course, will not be repurchasing this game unless I see some Major overhauls to the dynamic and specialist system in the coming future, otherwise I consider this game to be worthless.",

          "selftext": "  If you are a day trader this company plus most bio-tech companies aren't or shouldn't be in your radar. This stock isn't your short term gain but if its a long term investment then you have chosen wisely.  We have several very large companies like Black Rock that have our back.\n\nThere are 3 large hedge funds that will do anything to suppress the SP.  Sorrento has gotten 99 % of good news the past two months but due to the 3 hedge funds it has been a tough battle.  Short volume is especially high on Thursday and Friday due to Option expiration date.\n\nFDA has not been our friend since I'm 100% sure that the larger Pharma's reviews on medical products or  clinical evaluations gets pushed to the head of the line.  Look at the past leaders on FDA leaders look to see if they were previously working for large Pharmacy companies.\n\nSo Sorrento's is fighting two battles the 3 shorter hedge funds and the FDA.  The hedge funds are hoping that the day trader and other investors are willing to give up their retail stocks so that they can purchase them for pennies.\n\nI have learned my lesson while holding on to mostly oil funds for several years that you need to be patient.  Sorrento's financial situation is going to be very positive from the earning report from the 4th quarter.  \n\nIf you are smart enough a year from now.  SRNE won't be dealing with any short hedge funds.  We will just be patting ourselves on the back for making a smart decision.The pipeline is just to massive and I haven't heard anyone say the Pandemic is going away anytime soon.\n\nEnough of my issues that aren't in Sorrento's control.\n\nNow to October reviews:\n\nStock News:\n\nOct 26 Tip Ranks:\n\nH.C. Wainwright\u2019s [Ram Selvaraju](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/ram-selvaraju) thinks the stock is poised to claw back those gains and some. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on SRNE, along with a **$26 price target**. If correct, investors could be lining their pockets with a huge 286% gain.\n\nSelvaraju\u2019s latest endorsement follows a recent positive development. Last week, the company announced that COVISTIX, the company\u2019s 15-minute diagnostic test for the detection of Covid-19, has received a CE mark and marketing authorization from FAMHP (Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products). As many products need a CE marking before being given the go ahead in the EU, this opens the door for the test to enter the European markets.\n\nThe test has already been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the regulatory body in Mexico, and EUA filings are afoot in the United States, Canada and Brazil as well as with the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nCOVISTIX was shown to be highly accurate in a large independent study undertaken by INMEGEN (Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica, Mexico), boasting an 81% sensitivity rate compared to the 62% sensitivity rate exhibited by Panbio \u2013 the international leading rapid antigen test.\n\n\u201cThis finding is significant as higher COVISTIX sensitivity means fewer false negatives, which is essential to managing the spread of COVID virus infection and preventing the COVID disease, in particular those cases linked to highly transmissible variants of concern such as the Delta variant,\u201d Selvaraju noted.\n\nAlthough the analyst anticipates Sorrento\u2019s diagnostics offerings will generate \u201csubstantial revenue,\u201d Selvaraju reminds investors that his valuation assessment \u201cdoes not factor in any contribution\u201d from Sorrento\u2019s Covid-19 therapeutics pipeline. These could drive \u201cmeaningful upside\u201d to Selvaraju\u2019s forecasts.\n\nThe company is currently running several studies testing Covid-19 solutions. These include \u201cmultiple\u201d Phase 2 trials in the U.S. and U.K. for COVIDROPS, Sorrento\u2019s intranasal formulation of neutralizing antibody COVI-AMG. Sorrento intends to apply for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in several countries, should results prove positive.\n\nThere is also COVI-MSC, a proprietary preparation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), earmarked to begin a randomized, controlled clinical study. This drug could also \u201cqualify\u201d for an EUA before the end of the year, dependent on a positive outcome in the study. COVI-MSC is also undergoing Phase 2 testing in Brazil, for which patient enrollment began last month. The coming months should also see the release of top-line data from two Phase 2 trials of abivertinib, a Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor being assessed for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19-infected patients. \n\n[https://www.tipranks.com/news/corona/sorrento-covid-19-tests-could-generate-significant-revenue-says-analyst/](https://www.tipranks.com/news/corona/sorrento-covid-19-tests-could-generate-significant-revenue-says-analyst/)\n\n=================================================================================\n\nSorrento\u2019s Announcements:\n\nOct 27, 2021 \n\n[UPDATE  \u2013 Sorrento Announces Encouraging Results From Two Phase 2 Studies of Abivertinib For Treatment Of Hospitalized Severe COVID-19 Patients](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/update-sorrento-announces-encouraging-results-two-phase-2) \n\nOct 27, 2021 \n\n[Sorrento Announces Encouraging Results From Two Phase 2 Studies of Abivertinib For Treatment Of Hospitalized Severe COVID-19 Patients](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sorrento-announces-encouraging-results-two-phase-2-studies) \n\nOct 20, 2021 \n\n[Sorrento Announces That COVISTIX\u2122 (COVID-19 Virus Rapid Antigen Detection Test) Has Received a CE Mark and Registration of the Device](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sorrento-announces-covistixtm-covid-19-virus-rapid-antigen) \n\nOct 13, 2021 \n\n[Sorrento Receives FDA Clearance to Proceed With Clinical Trial for Anti-TROP-2 Antibody Drug Conjugate (TROP-2 ADC) for multiple solid tumors](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sorrento-receives-fda-clearance-proceed-clinical-trial-anti-trop) \n\nOct 13, 2021 \n\n[FDA Authorizes Sorrento Phase 2 Trial of Epidural Resiniferatoxin for the Orphan Indication of Control of Intractable Cancer Pain](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-authorizes-sorrento-phase-2-trial-epidural-resiniferatoxin) \n\n===============================================================================\n\nPatents:\n\n  **Date**  2021-10-28   [Antigen   Binding Proteins That Bind PD-L1](https://uspto.report/patent/app/20210330787)  \n   App 20210330787 - Zhou; Heyue ;   et al.\n\n  2021-10-26  [Antibody   therapeutics that bind CTLA4](https://uspto.report/patent/grant/11,155,623)  \n   Grant 11,155,623 - Gray , et al.

I had to go again before I left for school (I thought it was anxiety for a test I was about to take), but nothing good proceeded. I went to urgent care after about two hours of the fetal position on my bathroom floor for extreme abdominal pain, the kind where you lose your breath because it hurts so bad. I could barely walk. I got a CT with contrast as they suspected appendicitis, but they just found fluid in my abdomen. The good news is my appendix is okay, but they weren't sure what could have caused it other than maybe an ovarian cyst that ruptured(?). I got antibiotics and antiinflammatories and after about a week I felt normal again. My next period was almost all clots, but not the same as the usual clots I have, and very heavy but only lasted 3-4 days (normal in that aspect). \n\nI know I need to make an appointment with an OB regardless of this occurrence. I'm almost 21 and my periods are only just now regulating. Has anyone had this experience before? Does this sound like it was an ovarian cyst? I have ok pain tolerance, but this was the most painful thing that has ever happened to me. I thought I might be giving birth on the toilet lol. I'm worried that it will happen again as I know it is common for people to get multiples. I'm also irrationally afraid that one day it will be appendicitis and I'll think my ovaries are just revolting again.",

          "selftext": "The fire department in Virginia that I work for just had a hiring process. Typically, the process consists of an application, written test at the 6-8th grade level and a background check. This time around, applicants did not do a written examination. This was due to the fact that the city had settled with an applicant who failed the written exam and filed suit on the basis of the test being racially discriminatory. \n\nHaving taken the exam myself, I saw no indication of it being biased and it seemed to be on par for middle school math and reading comprehension. I say this as a college educated Asian male so that's solely my perspective. The candidate who failed and sued the city was a college educated black female.\n\nNew hires will have to complete 2 months of EMT-B training, 4 months of fire academy and 8 months of paramedic school. Needless to say, this is a fairly academically rigorous training process.\n\nBy not allowing a written test, how are we able to allow candidates to stand out in the hiring process? As it stands right now, the only way a candidate can stand out is prior certification in EMS and firefighting, and military service. There are plenty of good candidates that don't fit within those groups.\n\nI've seen literature on racial bias in standardized testing so I understand some of the arguments. However, the order from HR to discontinue written testing has put us in a strange predicament. What are some alternatives to written testing that are fair and useful in selecting appropriate candidates?",

Per our Google Mesh router speed tests we get 480/454. \n\nSetup: we have the main router in the basement and then a coax line (installed by Verizon) takes the signal to a router on the top floor from where it connects via network cable to the Google Best Mesh Router. \n\nWiFi speed on the main floor drops to 99/145. \n\nAny thoughts.

          "selftext": "Web Novel chapters: 20-50\n\nDisclaimer: This most likely will not be a 100% faithfully translation of the arc, and I will only cover the most important things, this will be the \u201cgeneral idea\u201d of the arc. \n\nThings might differ from the manga, since this is the \u201cWeb Novel\u201d and not the \u201cLight Novel\u201d where the manga takes the info, a example of that is the \u201cBrain Eaters\u201d (The plage mask doctors) that in the manga are already there and in the WN they don\u2019t appear until almost at the end of the arc.\n\nI\u2019ll start from the latest manga chapter where Isla was summoned\n\nThe treat betweet Phon\u2019kaven and Mynoghra is already in place and Atou, Moltar and a few Dark Elfs were send to Dragontan to defend the city against the barbarians. It\u2019s been a few attacks since then but Atou and Old man Moltar make quick work of the Barbarians, but then, something weird happen, one of the corpses of the enemy banish and a gold coin is there, Atou speaks telepathically with Takuto and he recognize the coin, in that moment, hundreds of barbarians appear to attack the city. Takuto tells Atou that the coins is from another game called \\[Brave Quest\\] an old RPG that has been ported and remaked a lot since its first release date a long time ago\n\nTakuto is angry at himself that he didn\u2019t consider the possibility of \u201cother games/characters\u201d may also appear in this world since they are already there.\n\nLeading the army of Barbarians is \u201cIce Rock\u201d one of the four heavenly kings of the Demon Army, Takuto gives Atou a quick review of the game lore and the enemies and she starts fighting Ice Rock\n\nThe game is a simple type RPG where the Hero goes to defeat the Demon King with his companions, they only have single target magic in the game and when Moltar uses an AoE magic against them Ice Rock is terrified of the potential that the enemies have.\n\nSince in the game the four heavenly kings can call allies without spend MP, Ice Rocks uses that multiples times against Atou, but she can manage since she has gotten stronger from all the fighting, then it\u2019s a 1 Vs 1, with Atou at the top the most time. When Ice Rocks is certain that he will die, he uses his \u201cfinisher\u201d where the opponent cannot evade it or hide from it, since it\u2019s a \u201crule\u201d in the game, Atou is attacked and surprised/angry that \u201crules from other games\u201d apply here without logic, after taking the hit, Atou finishes Ice Rock and start speaking to Takuto, but she receives information that Mynoghra is also currently under attack.\n\nThe scene changes from Dragontan to Mynoghra, an evacuation is currently in order, the Dark Elves are getting ready for the raid, and the twins Carrie and Marie are staying with Takuto. He has tought a way to solve this crisis and is leveling up Isla so she can obliterate the enemies with her army of bugs. Takuto gives the order and Isla goes into the forest to engage the enemy\n\nThe scene shift to another demon commander: Fremine, a mage who can control fire at will, he encounters Isla and start mocking Takuto to get her angry, the fight starts and it seems like Isla won, but then something weird happens, even though Fremine is a corpse in tatters, he can still speak, Fremine knows he was from a game and calls for his \\[Forced Event\\] where in the original title, when the Hero Party killed Fremine, he exploded killing one of the Hero\u2019s companion, here he is using that as an attack to get Isla, in that moment, Carrie and Marie gets teleported in front of Isla, Fremine will kill the twins to at least get Isla to be angry and sad. The explosion happens and Isla covered Marie and Carrie and now she is dying.\n\nSince is been a while since Isla was summoned, she grew attached to the twins and they saw Isla as her second mother, the girls are crying loud and start apologizing and begging Isla to not die. She offers the girls her heart.\n\nFrom the leveling up that Isla went through before the battle, she learned a skill that can give the \u201cstrength of a hero to another unit\u201d by eating her heart, she is doing that with the twins, they are crying because they are eating their \u201cmother\u201d again, she forces the girls to do so and then she dies.\n\nA \u201csystem error\u201d happens, since that skill was meant to give birth to one hero, not two. The Witches of Regret are born, and they are fucking pissed with the worls and the enemies since they aren\u2019t allowed to be happy.\n\nTakuto gives Atou the bad news, she is angry and sad that Isla is gone, and Takuto tells her to stop the sisters because they are going straight to the enemy commanders, Atou dashes into the forest from Dragontan\n\nLady Wind, one of the four heavenly king, is facing Carrie, she catches that the burned girl is an enemy and orders her minions to attack her, but the moment an attack hits her, the part on wich they attack her start rotting, everything rots around her. Lady Wind realizes that she cannot win against Carrie and start thinking of running, but the moment she wants to move, she froze, because in Brave Quest, the Boss will never run away. Lady Wind dies by rotting\n\nOld Mechanic, the last of the four heavenly kings faces Marie, Old-M is a robot type demon who can uses various types of mechanics to attack, but when he starts thinking of attacking, he forgets how to do so, this is because of a skill of Marie &lt;&lt;Idiot Infection&gt;&gt;, Old-M start forgetting everything and presumably only is left as an empty shell\n\nThe sisters are now against the Demon King, he start talking on how this was all a test given by God, to conquest a new world free of pollution like his old world, the battle start by him transforming into his \u201cfinal form\u201d because since this isn\u2019t a scripted game, he can uses all of his power from the start, he start doing barrier type of spell but it doesn\u2019t work on the sisters because they are now a \u201cHero\u201d, the sisters with their new skills make quick work of the Demon King, and before he was going to die, he start talking about \u201cGod\u201d and because of his will, his wound start disappearing. \n\nWhen the Demon King was getting ready to start fighting again he was going to say the \u201cGod\u201d name and a \u201cSystem message\u201d appears \u201cDo not speak of the name of god unnecessarily\u201d, just then another person appears and give him the finishing blow, a normal guy.\n\nThe sisters are cautious of him, at that moment Atou also appears beside the sisters, the sisters are pissed because they wanted to give the Demon King the finishing blow, the guy talks that he only wanted to help because they seems troubled, he starts to talk a little on how they should not attack him because he was stronger, then the guy runs away.\n\nAtou is now there with the sisters who start crying for Isla since the battle is over.\n\n\\[Southern Hydragia: Unknown land\\]\n\nThe same guy who finished the Demon King was now almost crying of fear of the three girls who he met before, he was only a normal human before, but not from this world, he is just a \u201csummoned hero\u201d who God gave him the order to wipe out the evil of the world\n\nYes, he died by a truck.\n\nGod gave him a female companion to aid him in his quest, but is more a slave than a fighter.\n\nThe man starts complaining to God on how little info he gave him before sending him to the forest\n\nThat man was sent by the \u201cPlayful God\u201d\n\n\\[Holy Kingodm Qualia: The Witch Incident\\]\n\nA few villages where already devasted because of the witch Erakino. The saint Soalia was sent to finish her, but with almost 30 victories, Soalia cannot finish Erakino, when she is killed, she just revives.\n\nThey start talking a bit, on how Erakino just wants to befriend Soalia and make a \u201cNice country\u201d then she says that before this only his master has rolled the dice and today, she will do it.\n\nShe rolled a 100, then the situation changed, a message was heard to both of them, Soalina was now under brainwashing and she was willing to talk to Erakino now\n\nErakino is happy now because of her new friend and start demanding praise from his master, the Game Master \\[GM\\], but he starts giving her info about Mynoghra and how to start conquering the world\n\nThey are from of a \u201cGame of Dice\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGod of Dice\u201d send them into this world\n\n\\[El-Nah: Etro Quar\\] (The Elf country)\n\nEl-Nah is currently also with a invasion from an unknown source, they are to prideful to seek help from Qualia and they also do not know if they\u2019ll help because the problem with the Witch at the north (Erakino) and they will solve this problem on their own\n\nThey are\u2026 and get this\u2026 they are getting invaded by succubus from an Eroge (erotic game) they are a high-level race from that game comparable to the latest aircraft carrier\n\nThe Chaste Queen of the Succubus, Vagia send by the \u201cGod of Expansion\u201d will now start the world conquest\n\n\\[Mynoghra: Royal Palace\\]\n\nEveryone was there to discuss about the battle. Everyone was down because the loss of Isla and how that will affect them, since she gave a bug a bonus of +2 in attack, now that is gone\n\nHe starts apologizing to the sisters and the others because of his lack of insight, and now he will stop \u201cplaying around\u201d\n\nTakuto will try to get the \u201cAscended Ending\u201d of Eternal Nations by conquering all the world and by doing so, he can revive Isla, the sisters are on board with the plan and Takuto start using magic to create modern type weapons, grenade, etc.\n\nSomewhere \u201cA God Without name\u201d was laughing loudly at Takuto's will to conquer the world\n\n\\[Real World\\]\n\ncLoser is the number one in Eternal Nation in Game E-Sports, in interviews he often talks on how even though he is the number one, he has never won against \u201cIra=Takuto\u201d in the ranking inside the game, he is number one because Takuto has never gone into a live event.\n\nThe public believes that \u201cIra=Takuto\u201d is a AI, but cLoser spoke with him only one by voice-chat and knows he cannot appear in public because his sickness, he tells the interviewer that if you play against Takuto when he is set on winning, only a crushing defeats awaits you\n\nEnd of the Arc",

          "selftext": "This is a serious question. I got played by a girl when I turned 20 and It hurted so bad I started watching self development stuff on internet for the first time.\n\nI realized I should never had considered a specific woman like she was special or something therefore acted too available despite having other options.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in alpha males etc but I came across life coachs that consider monogamy as \u201cbeta\u201d and honestly ever since I watch these articles I realize women respect me a lot more since I got rid of the idea of focusing on a deep relationship with one girl and fuck around instead. Surprisingly, I have more success, I don\u2019t get played, everyone around me including male friends don\u2019t try to take advantage of me. Even still I\u2019ve never been a doormat, I realized people test you when you are genuinely nice and respect you when they have something to fear from you. It\u2019s ducked up honestly but you live and learn.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this ? Especially nowadays with all the options people have, some consider monogamy is becoming the backup plan for losers and we, as men, shouldn\u2019t consider building something with only one woman.\n\nThis is a real question, not an opinion. I genuinely heard about this several times to the point I started questioning myself.",

People explained this to me a bit before but I didn't really comprehend it and I was working on another theory.  But now I'm coming back to this.\n\nAlso, if the problem is the \"divet\" then wouldn't the brakes snap back into place once I force them off the rotor?  \n\nHow can I really test if the problem is the divet or the caliper or something else?\n\nThank you.",

Things like the jukebox, different types of beer, the barrel game, the dice in the drop pod, and the soccer game make the game fun and enjoyable.\n\nHere are some ideas for future updates and I'm pretty sure some of these ideas have already been suggested:\n\n1. Paintball guns in the space station. \n2. Upgrades for Molly (ex- speed boost, a small gun)\n3. Cosmetic options for the drop pod\n4. A range to test out weapons\n5. Mini campaign (i know that this is very difficult to do)\n6. Purchasing food to get an additional food. It could be at the bar or a vending machine\n7. Tattoo options for dwarfs\n\nThoughts?",

          "selftext": "**\\[1\\] Drama over facts**\n\nThe main focus of the storyline that Borba's \"Trilogy of Life\" portrays would be the fact that BJudy had an abortion and somehow stated that she was the \"first rabbit\" to do so.\n\nHowever, if you were to get the facts about her ability to have the hybrid baby, the history of abortion, and pred/prey relations, you'd see why she was not only capable of carrying the baby despite Borba's vehement arguments against it, but also why she couldn't be the first rabbit to have an abortion.\n\nBorba stated that BJudy wouldn't be able to carry the baby to term due to Judy's size and weight:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/877101728/4938027039](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/877101728/4938027039)\n\nNick, on his application, states that he's 4' and 80lbs. Red foxes generally weigh about 30lbs.\n\nSo taking this into account, even if you were to say that Nick would be about 2.6 times the normal weight of his species and apply the same for Judy (European rabbits are about 5lbs), that would make her about 13lbs.\n\nHowever, she's taller than Otterton with a shorter (scut) tail, but longer ears. So there's no way that she weighs 13lbs.\n\nHere's the closest estimation of Judy's size and weight:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/5d1bbi/estimating\\_judys\\_weight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/5d1bbi/estimating_judys_weight/)\n\nSo it's about 36 to 80. Judy would be close to half his weight in this estimation, and close to half his height in renderings.\n\nKeep that in mind and you'll see why the argument collapses in on itself in IWS upon further inspection.\n\nIn IWS, you'd see that other couples with vastly disproportionate weights were able to have children of their own as seen on page 10 of I Will Survive.\n\nThe ones with the most notably disproportionate weight would be the Bull Moose and Doe, and the vixen and what appears to be a Timber Wolf:\n\n[https://e926.net/posts/1192490](https://e926.net/posts/1192490?q=borba)\n\nFor those of you that don't know, e926 is the safe version of its counterpart.\n\nAs stated above, the weight of the average red fox is about 30lbs, but as this would be stretched for Zootopia counterparts, the female would be about 64 or so (female red foxes weigh about 20% less than males), with the timberwolf being about 60-110 lbs.\n\nThe wolf in this picture is much taller and much heavier than his mate. So it would be at the higher end of the scale, but still close to half the height and weight for the couple.\n\nThe other one is more disproportionate. With the deer species shown being about 100lbs (most likely white tailed deer doe there) and the average bull moose being 1000lbs or more (1,500), it's beyond what the ratio should be, even if you halve the weight of the moose.\n\nDespite this, they were still capable of having the child they wanted and were well within the parameters for doing so.\n\nSo, if you were going by size and weight, then it would be safe to say that these couples would be in the right range to have children of their own.\n\nFor those that are even attempting to make the \"chromosomes\" argument and saying that it would never happen for BNick and BJudy, there's a sheep and a pig pairing. Count their chromosomes: 54 for sheep, 38 for pigs.\n\nAnd for that matter, the whole \"pred/prey\" argument falls apart when you realize that pigs aren't technically herbivores. They're omnivore/scavengers, even the domestic ones.\n\nAnyone trying the \"but it's pred/prey and it never happened in the history of Zootopia\" argument, that would be a statistical anomaly at best.\n\nThat would be like saying that the taboo was never crossed, that the world's oldest profession doesn't exist (The Longest Night), or that slavery or general curiosity never happened.\n\nIt would be statistically incorrect to say that such a thing has never happened historically. And even if you were to go with Judy being the \"first rabbit cop so maybe,\", that doesn't make her the first rabbit warrior as seen in the Museum scene. Those spears weren't just for roasting carrots.\n\nAs for the predator/prey relationships, they don't seem too rare if a predator is able to ask prey out in the open:\n\n[https://zootopia.fandom.com/wiki/Hyena\\_customer](https://zootopia.fandom.com/wiki/Hyena_customer)\n\nAnd that's a part of the official Disney comic.\n\nFor the record, a male spotted hyena weighs from 89-120lbs (40-54kg) and the heaviest three-toed-sloth is from 9-22 lbs (4-9kg)\n\nEven if you were to take the size and weight for the sloth and do the same proportions as done for Judy's above, it would be about half the size and weight of the predator counterpart.\n\nBesides all of this, notice in the comic how many kits were had per litter: just one. Even with the fox/wolf family that has multiple pups per litter. The ones shown are different ages.\n\nWhile the size of a fox kit and bunny kit are different, the compensation for the size appears to be constant in the comic.\n\nSo all of the arguments made for the side of them not being able to have kits falls apart as soon as you get to page 10 of IWS.\n\nBJudy wouldn't be the first rabbit to have an abortion as the practice of abortion has been around for over 2,000 years.\n\nHistorically, Aristotle (Written at about 350 B.C. Politics, Book 7, section 1335B), and Tertullian (Written about 200 A.D. De Anima Chapter 25 in which he lists out tools for the procedure) show that it's been around for longer than the 19th century.\n\n[https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:345745](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:345745)\n\nIn fact, you could have just gone here and seen this as a starting reference point:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\\_of\\_abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_abortion)\n\nThe earliest references go back to the mid 1,500's B.C.\n\nSo this makes abortion far older than preventative measures such as the victorian era sheep-gut condoms. And yes, it's exactly what it sounds like.\n\nAnd for a timeline reference as to why this would be a modern age in Zootopia, note that Judy quotes Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933).\n\nSterilization existed in the 1930's in veterinary practices and later on. Such practices, however, were not limited to animals in the years following. Not only this, but veterinary practices offer abortion services as well as spay/neuter.\n\nIn the movie, there were flyers advertising for rabbits to get themselves \"fixed\".\n\nThe term being that of spay/neuter, and is seen several times.\n\nOnce on a fence when Nick and Judy come out of an alley:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/5hem1k/some\\_signs\\_plus\\_judy\\_being\\_judy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/5hem1k/some_signs_plus_judy_being_judy/)\n\nAnd the other time in Bunnyburrow when Judy's wrapping carrots up for sale just before Gideon's apology. If you look closely at the bottom right corner at the start of the video, it's the same advertisement:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB021VKnVvE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB021VKnVvE)\n\nAn ad for bunnies to get spayed/neutered in Bunnyburrow is no coincidence. Again, as stated above, veterinary clinics do preform abortions. It would be a stretch to say that they offer one, but not the other.\n\nSo from the targeted ad and the history of the practice, there would be no way for BJudy to be the first rabbit to have had an abortion.\n\nAlso, the word fetus etymologically means: \"the bearing or hatching of young, a bringing forth, pregnancy, childbearing, offspring,\" or simply, \"the unborn offspring of an animal that develops from an embryo.\" This is after fertilization of an egg, so BJudy's original statement of \"there is no baby\" is wrong by definition.\n\nNone of these facts, nor this logic was addressed in Borba's arguments.\n\nBut then again, Borba has said that logic is irrelevant in a fantasy world in his \"Spock/Chewbacca Defense\":\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/667641767/4350996866](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/667641767/4350996866)\n\nSo, by that logic, the logic that he gave in defending his stance would have to be thrown out just to be coherent to the law of non-contradiction.\n\nCan't have your cake and eat it, too.\n\nBesides that, Borba also stated that IWS isn't about abortion:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/667002386/4513189467](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/667002386/4513189467)\n\nSo the topic of abortion wasn't tackled, it was satirized and a red herring:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/683814995/4514116310](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/683814995/4514116310)\n\n**\\[2\\] Why Shay exists**\n\nFor anyone that was surprised when Shay appeared and it became BJudy x Shay in a relationship, take a moment to look through Borba's old work in his gallery:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/borba/gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/borba/gallery)\n\nSo it really shouldn't be as surprising as a bolt from the blue for BJudy x Shay to be the relationship chosen, it's par for the course for his works.\n\nAnyone still not believing this, search the gallery for \"Evandria and Bremusia\" it should still be there.\n\nBesides that, Shay is a knockoff version of Skye. Skye was the unused character in Zootopia's deleted storyline when it was a spy thriller.\n\n[https://zootopia.fandom.com/wiki/Skye](https://zootopia.fandom.com/wiki/Skye)\n\nBorba denies this:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/779192853/4684432116](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/779192853/4684432116)\n\nNote that, contrary to Borba's denial, Shay just so happens to be a vixen mechanic with light-tan fur and blue eyes (every trait of Skye) when she's first shown.\n\nDespite this, Byron Howard knows who the character is:\n\n[https://twitter.com/ByronPHoward/status/833034294444519424](https://twitter.com/ByronPHoward/status/833034294444519424)\n\n[https://twitter.com/ByronPHoward/status/663754157162041344](https://twitter.com/ByronPHoward/status/663754157162041344)\n\nAnd the \"No\" is in reference to the question asked at the beginning of the statement. Byron is being asked if the white wolf painted on the side of Finnick's van is Skye.\n\nWhile the answer is no, there is no denial or correction at the name given for the unused vixen.\n\nAs for why Shay and not BNick, it's all for BJudy's career.\n\nWhen BJudy managed to get pregnant by her partner, he went from being an asset to a liability. When it was a \"friends with benefits\" relationship that had no consequences and didn't interfere with any aspect of her career, he was the safe option for her.\n\nHowever, as a liability, she couldn't risk being with him again as even the best preventative measures may put her career at risk again.\n\nThat said, the spay/neuter option would be available, and it could be either one of them.\n\nThe other option available would be to get someone else that has no possibility of pregnancy risk.\n\nThis is where Shay comes in. She's a predator to keep up the pred/prey dynamic, a copy of Skye, and her character is zero risk to BJudy's career.\n\nFrom that standpoint, she's also BJudy's scapegoat.\n\nIn BtBA, BJudy blames BNick for him leaving her after she assaulted him for him telling her off. BNick was the fox that would challenge her career, ideals, and question her motives and not be complicit with her choices, but push back.\n\nThat's not a partner.\n\nNick and Judy are partners. They complement each other's qualities, challenge one another's ideas, and communicate.\n\nJack and Skye were designed as partners. Skye's bio shows that she was to accompany Jack on some of his missions. She had his back and vice versa.\n\nShay won't step out of line. She was designed to be timid, complicit, and non-confrontational to complement BJudy's career.\n\nThe design of her character isn't that of a partner, that's a crutch.\n\nThe difference between a partner and a crutch is that a partner is a person that can help you get to where you're going while a crutch is a thing that will help you go where you want.\n\nThat's why Shay's character was made. She was the prefered fox that wouldn't interfere with BJudy's career.\n\nIf it was a vixen with Nick's personality, it wouldn't have worked. Someone sassy that challenged BJudy's ideals or had an opinion about her choices wouldn't have been paired with her. This is a narcissistic relationship.\n\nSo for the people that kept saying \"BJudy said gay rights\", would that apply to a character created for the sole purpose of fulfilling a narcissists career drive?\n\nAfter all, Borba did state that BtBA wasn't about anything LGBT, and that it was just used as a plot device:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/777224225/4679331617](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/777224225/4679331617)\n\n**\\[3\\] Holes in the narrative**\n\nFor starters, the whole story is an AU, not a continuation.\n\nBJudy's a sergeant in the comic Afternoon at the Mall (page 5), so the next step up would be lieutenant as seen in \"I Will Survive\" (Page 12).\n\nWhy it's an AU is due to BJudy being promoted to sergeant before Nick joined the ZPD. This is not canon to the story as Judy has no insignia on her collar when she pinned on Nick's badge.\n\nBesides this, it would take years on the force to become a sergeant, not two cases and about a year.\n\nIf it was corporal, would be believable:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police\\_ranks\\_of\\_the\\_United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_ranks_of_the_United_States)\n\nBorba also low-key confirmed that BJudy was the Chief of police:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/872324877/4906573267](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/872324877/4906573267)\n\nThat would have been the perfect time to clarify or correct, but it was an agreement to the promotions in their order.\n\nWhat's wrong with this is that BJudy would have been too young and inexperienced to be the Chief.\n\nWith her being a lieutenant at 26 with a short tenure as the Chief of police and then the Mayor, that's a lot to happen in just a short time.\n\nNot that there haven't been young police Chief's:\n\n[https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/countrys-youngest-police-chief-takes-the-reins-at-huntington-university/](https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/countrys-youngest-police-chief-takes-the-reins-at-huntington-university/)\n\n[https://bangordailynews.com/2016/04/14/news/23-year-old-may-be-maines-youngest-police-chief/](https://bangordailynews.com/2016/04/14/news/23-year-old-may-be-maines-youngest-police-chief/)\n\nThese are for small towns and a college campus, not a metropolis. This would be a lot of seniority thrown out the window in order to make her Mayor for a story.\n\nAnd the stories being a succession is canon to Borba's word:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/871019611/4904008546](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/871019611/4904008546)\n\nHe eventually ends up denying it multiple times:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/875462126/4912896517](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/875462126/4912896517)\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/875462126/4913175826](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/875462126/4913175826)\n\nDespite the memory bubbles in NSG (Page 13:[ https://e926.net/posts/2624979](https://e926.net/posts/2624979))\n\n\"Night Howlers Effect\" (Page 7)\n\n\"ZPD's Party Night\" (Page 5)\n\n\"Where is the Foscar?\"\n\n\"I Will Survive\" (Page 5)\n\n\"Born To Be Alive\" (Page 14)\n\nSo it's all canon to NSG even when he contradicts himself by denying it.\n\nAlso, with him saying that all the stories are canon (despite denial), the two act nothing like cops.\n\nBNick could smell BJudy's emotions through her scent ([https://e926.net/posts/1980590](https://e926.net/posts/1980590?pool_id=18216)), but he didn't notice the scent of her pregnancy before BJudy did in IWS.\n\nThat, and where Nick is observant, BNick didn't see the pregnancy tests next to the groceries right in front of him in \"Where's the Foscar\".\n\nBJudy completely forgot that she's a cop somehow and assaulted her subordinate in IWS. If anyone didn't know, assaulting an officer would be automatically upgraded to aggravated assault.\n\nIf you wanted any kind of Internal Affairs investigation on you, this would be a good way to do that: having anyone in any leadership position abuse their power and attack their subordinate that they're in a relationship with.\n\nThat is grounds for separation at least, and, given the situation, dismissal.\n\nBorba acknowledges this:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/4/306626/4612870845](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/4/306626/4612870845)\n\nAnd the trilogy of life storyline is the complete opposite of the dialogue here:\n\n[https://e926.net/posts/1980666](https://e926.net/posts/1980666)\n\n[https://e926.net/posts/1980669](https://e926.net/posts/1980669)\n\nThere's also the little fact that BJudy met Shay probably a week or two after BNick left.\n\nIf you're going by rabbit gestation periods, then BJudy would have been carrying to full term in about a month. Rabbit kits are small.\n\nThat coupled with BJudy being compulsive, she would have had the abortion within the span of a week or so. And, from the complications, she met Shay.\n\nThen there's the discrepancy of BJudy's age.\n\nShe apparently met Shay at the hospital when she was 27:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/874327127/4910325420](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/874327127/4910325420)\n\nBut, somehow, BJudy was 26 in BtBA:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/870280696/4902612432](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/870280696/4902612432)\n\nAnd, as before, BJudy was 32 when she was elected, but was somehow the Chief of Police sometime between BtBA and NSG. She was 26, and a lieutenant, with the position of Chief being that of a Metropolis. While Clawhauser's now somehow the Chief in the NSG extra pages as noted by the stars on his collar.\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/872324877/4906624511](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/872324877/4906624511)\n\nAnd as far as how long BNick was an officer, it would have been a few months.\n\nGiven that Nick was 32 when he met Judy in the movie and it was about 3 months from the press conference to Dawn's arrest ([https://twitter.com/\\_rich\\_moore/status/729031671933075456](https://twitter.com/_rich_moore/status/729031671933075456)) and a further 9 months of training for Nick in the ZPA ([https://twitter.com/\\_rich\\_moore/status/715097813160316928](https://twitter.com/_rich_moore/status/715097813160316928)), he would be 33 in IWS.\n\nYet, he left at the end of that and came back in BtBA and was 34 as he was gone for a year. That's a short tenure for a cop.\n\nThen there was the retconning with the time on the clock in BtBA. On page 13, the time is 1:15 A.M. However, on page 14, it's 3:20 A.M. only on the Deviant Art page. Anywhere else you look, it will read 1:20 A.M.\n\nAnd more retconning as the ring on BNick's finger wasn't originally there. If you go anywhere that the first 9 pages are posted outside of DA, the ring isn't there, neither is the watch. Here's Reddit for example:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/kyuu9q/never\\_say\\_goodbye\\_page\\_3\\_borba/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/kyuu9q/never_say_goodbye_page_3_borba/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/lcip0x/never\\_say\\_goodbye\\_page\\_9\\_borba/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/lcip0x/never_say_goodbye_page_9_borba/)\n\n[https://e926.net/posts/2707367](https://e926.net/posts/2707367)\n\nThe ringless and watchless version is not an edit, there would have to be a separate image for the ringed version.\n\nIf it was that important to the story, they wouldn't have been so easily missed.\n\nOn top of this, BJudy was designed to make poor decisions.\n\nStarting in a Day at the Mall as a Sergeant, she was a Lieutenant in BtBA, and the Chief of Police according to Borba.\n\nA character with this much of a police background should not be this incompetent about security and serious, life threatening attacks when attacks of the Nighthowler incident were done in public view.\n\nAnd for people saying that her character made smart choices, think about this.\n\nBJudy's character didn't heed any sort of advice with a known threat to their life, put herself and her family in danger in prideful display of power to show that she's not scared of the enemy by being fully in public and getting into a 1930's, JFK referenced vehicle instead of opting for a modern limo with a roof like that of Mr. Big.\n\n[https://e926.net/posts/2645665](https://e926.net/posts/2645665)\n\nSafe guess that the last word there is \"die\". And BNick's grammatical mistake is there as well.\n\nBorba did say that BJudy's career was the most important thing to her. Period:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/675920908/4374176551](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/675920908/4374176551)\n\nThere's also a pattern in the Trilogy of Life comics. BJudy makes a choice, acts irrationally, shocking twist, and everyone's left crying in the end.\n\nIWS: BJudy argues with BNick, assaults him, he leaves, they're both crying in the end.\n\nBtbA: BJudy, being the homeowner, allows her inebriated ex into her house with her current love interest, pins the blame on him for her part of the reason of why he left, mocks him, a fight breaks out, and she pushes him out and they're all left crying.\n\nNSG: BJudy makes picking up her spouse and kids a public event, ignores the advice of BNick, leaves in a fully exposed car, gets JFK'd (almost), everybody's left crying in the end only for it to be a joke about the historical event.\n\nHer character was written to ensure that her actions and inability to take advice leaves every character in tears at the end of the story. Three times.\n\nAnd this entire line of logic is just flawed:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/897536848/4952205767](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/897536848/4952205767)\n\nNone of the predators smelled cherries, and BJudy waited so long to pop back up or the amount of cherry jam is just excessive drama. Nobody checked on the supposed corpse and saw that it was cherry jam when blood is much thinner.\n\nNot even Carrotholocism has any background when questioned:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/874327127/4910964925](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/874327127/4910964925)\n\nSo to sum up the story, it's about a covert narcissistic careerist, her simp of an ex, and her milquetoast satellite love interest that was made for her career all for the sake of drama.\n\n**\\[4\\] Community remarks, inaccuracies, rebuttals, and narcissism**\n\nThroughout the story, BJudy has been shown to portray an ever increasing narcissistic personality.\n\nThis is in contrast to the Judy from the movie, though Borba says that he made her the same:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/826297686/4808359448](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/826297686/4808359448)\n\nAnd here's information about the narcissistic personality:\n\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662)\n\nNote the common themes: exaggerated sense of self-importance, sense of entitlement and require constant, excessive admiration, preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate, monopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferior, unquestioning compliance with their expectations, inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others, arrogant or haughty manner, coming across as conceited, boastful and pretentious.\n\nThe personality enjoys toying with people's emotions, testing people's boundaries because they can, provocation for entertainment, and gaslighting and denying (lying) where possible to get out of a situation that they caused.\n\nAnd criticizing a narcissist can lead to: reaction with rage or contempt and trying to belittle the other person to make themselves appear superior, difficulty regulating emotions and behavior, secret feelings of insecurity, shame, vulnerability and humiliation.\n\nThey don't like to be culpable for their actions.\n\nSo where people attempt to justify BJudy's actions, they're justifying the actions of a narcissist.\n\nThen there's also some of the points to the personality such as: Inability to admit mea culpa, constant lying, alethophobia (look the word up), portent to provoke for no apparent reason other than to test boundaries (more on this later), lashing out at anyone having objections to your position that's stronger when they prove that stance wrong, controlling and manipulative, won't take responsibility for their actions and brush them off as if nothing happened, usually won't bother with the facts, can't handle criticism.\n\nAnd, of course, projection, and will do or say anything to get out of a situation that they caused, to the point of lying, gaslighting, denial, and erasing evidence.\n\nIn fact, this is the closest thing to her personality type as explained by a licensed Psychologist:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuNeX3fbvM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGuNeX3fbvM)\n\nAnd even if you come to terms with this and decide to either forgive a narcissist, or want forgiveness, here's what usually happens:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GBTgZb8b4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2GBTgZb8b4)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TydGE8MJjTQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TydGE8MJjTQ)\n\nEven in the comment section, this is what happens with that personality type.\n\nAnd, even if you forgive someone, that doesn't mean that they change. They can choose to do that on their own. Forgiveness doesn't mean you have to continue to put up with someone else's actions. That's enabling.\n\nOne of the best things to do is nothing and leave. Narcissists don't change. You'll get something that looks like it for a while, but it will be back to the same song and dance eventually. So for anyone believing that it gets better, it's a waste of time.\n\nFor anyone that gets the reference and wants to know a good response, do everything you need to get off their central finite curve.\n\nWhenever you confront a narcissist, be aware that their flying monkeys (narcisist supporters/enablers) are usually around.\n\nIf you want to identify this kind of person, just look for people who keep supporting the ego of a narcissist. They will generally fall back to nothing but insults, gaslight, and provide faulty information.\n\nFor example:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/895284151/4949160591](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/895284151/4949160591)\n\nHere's more information on this personality type:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDclCIFQML8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDclCIFQML8)\n\nAnd if anyone can recall that whole debacle with the DeviantArt ban for underaged porn and believed that it was just a rumor, it was very real.\n\nHe even provided a link:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/699597910/4465509939](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/699597910/4465509939)\n\nAnd he stated that he posted that to \"poke the lion to see if it was sleeping\" and how far he could go, though he said that he doesn't draw porn:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/716229265/4515604131](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/716229265/4515604131)\n\nFor those that don't want to see/know what it is, it's Ben10 (underage) about to get it on with an alien girl (Attea) with belly button genitalia.\n\nAnd, if that link somehow disappears for whatever reason, you can still find it on rule 34(phael, not the other one) under the search for Ben 10 and Attea.\n\nThen there was the \"Sappho\" thing that was deleted:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20171209081744/https://borba.deviantart.com/art/Perverted-Sappho-439545773](https://web.archive.org/web/20171209081744/https://borba.deviantart.com/art/Perverted-Sappho-439545773)\n\nNote the response to praise.\n\nThen Borba stated that the groups that are in oppostion to BJudy are representative to people that don't support him (his critics) and he compares them to Nazi's, communists, and the right:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/872603076/4906999183](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/872603076/4906999183)\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/896818519/4951449638](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/896818519/4951449638)\n\nSo it could be said that the entire thing is political what with the symbolism of the elephant (republicans), the donkey mask (democrats) and the bear (likely communists) and that the blame is shifted to say the people that don't support Borba's stance is what tried to kill the covert-narcissist, BJudy and not her actions that were narrated for her.\n\nThis coming from the same person that made this statement (you'll need to translate this):\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/681214929/4392534083](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/681214929/4392534083)\n\nHitler, being the unrecognized artist who chose a different path in life. There was also Josef Mengle (a.k.a. the Angel of Death), having having moved to South America (Brazil) and continued his practices of abortions and experiments that focused primarily on twins.\n\nIt  shouldn't come as a surprise:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/faduu2/im\\_getting\\_bored\\_so\\_be\\_blessed/fj0p318/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/faduu2/im_getting_bored_so_be_blessed/fj0p318/)\n\nWho thinks highly of himself:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/848503810/4884571273](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/848503810/4884571273)\n\nOr believes that reconciliation doesn't work (needs to be translated):\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/774799780/4673174138](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/774799780/4673174138)\n\nThough, it's all just shock material for the sake of attention:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/675920908/4374589967](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/675920908/4374589967)\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/710680316/4626579358](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/710680316/4626579358)\n\nAnd also showed that he didn't post the comic in 2020 due to fear of backlash:\n\n[https://twitter.com/BorbaReal/status/1352346961505103874](https://twitter.com/BorbaReal/status/1352346961505103874)\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/836251171/4889099403](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/836251171/4889099403)\n\nBut was able to get away with posting it in 2021 when the heat died down from the riots and politics to be able to get away with Trump/Hilary hair BJudy, the subverted JFK, Brer Rabbit wearing a BLM shirt in the bottom right corner of NSG page 24, making allusions to people that disagree with him to be either a Nazi, Communist, or the right, and others.\n\nAnd even said this:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/836251171/4865281019](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/836251171/4865281019)\n\nWith a mentality like that for saying \"no\", you could defend people like Ted Bundy.\n\nThen there's things like the dress from the dream comic looking familiar:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/borba/art/I-Want-To-Dream-Of-You-Forever-08-and-09-699597910](https://www.deviantart.com/borba/art/I-Want-To-Dream-Of-You-Forever-08-and-09-699597910)\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/spintherella/art/Inter-schminter-5-11-622983106](https://www.deviantart.com/spintherella/art/Inter-schminter-5-11-622983106)\n\nThere was also an argument in BtBA that kept recurring with people saying that a fetus is a parasite. Going by that statement, logically, every organism would have to be a parasite.\n\nFun fact, a parasite doesn't stop being a parasite in any stage of its life. Be it from sustenance of another organism or reproductive like that of a Jewel Wasp, it's still a parasite.\n\nAnd, I just wanted to address this:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/848695705/4859929744](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/848695705/4859929744)\n\nThe \"bitch\" comment is correct by definition:\n\n[https://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/language-linguistics-and-literary-terms/english-vocabulary-d/bitch](https://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/language-linguistics-and-literary-terms/english-vocabulary-d/bitch)\n\nBut nothing was done about the word \"bitchwhore\" in most of the tags in TLN.\n\nAnd a few rebuttals.\n\nLike the \"time heals all wounds\" quote.\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/877101728/4916045475](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/877101728/4916045475)\n\nTime doesn't heal all wounds. If you or anyone you know has ever been wounded (physically, emotionally, psychologically), was it time itself that healed that wound?\n\nBecause if time did, then with that miracle cure, go to any hospital and tell every patient there that they got it all wrong and that it's \"time\" that heals them. Sent to the trauma center? Have severe burns? Suffering from any form of psychosis? Hearing voices that tell you to commit crimes?\n\nHopefully by the time you finish your speech about time healing everything, you'll be escorted off the premises or be told by any physician that it's not time alone that heals your wounds. It's treatment that heals your wounds over time.\n\nIf you never got the treatment, then never expect to get better.\n\nSo, the next time you get wounded and say that it's \"time\" that heals all your wounds, just remember that amputation and cauterization of limbs is as much of a form of treatment as a common bandaid, talking to a counselor or therapist, and medication for those voices you've been hearing.\n\nYour inaction in treating your wounds doesn't get them healed.\n\nIt wasn't \"time\" that healed the wounds between nations at the end of WWII. It was sanctions, changes of government, interpols, trade, multiple forms of aid, and communication. It's not like they didn't speak to one another in 10 years and said that everything was fine between them out of the clear blue without acknowledging what they did wrong.\n\nSo if you still believe that it's time that heals all wounds, then the next time you get wounded (physically, emotionally, psychologically) and you want to prove this wrong, don't get any form of help. Because, if you do get treatment, any kind of aid for your wounds, then you'll have proved yourself wrong.\n\nSo, \"time\" helps exacerbate untreated wounds. However, \"treatment\" heals wounds over time.\n\nThen there's the \"Tu Quoque\" (you as well) argument:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/873963396/4909630097](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/873963396/4909630097)\n\nThe difference in the relationships between Ratatouille and IWS is that one was made to force a previously established relationship apart. The other was used to wake a sleeping Linguine to start a relationship.\n\nThen there was the whole OOC fallacy thing:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/borba/journal/Brief-study-about-the-OOC-fallacy-677943342](https://www.deviantart.com/borba/journal/Brief-study-about-the-OOC-fallacy-677943342)\n\nAnd he used someone else's post to defend the fallacy:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/677943342/4389799317](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/677943342/4389799317)\n\nGranted, Judy did some things wrong in the movie. Suspecting Nick without any evidence, but going off of what Jerry said was a bad idea, but she eventually saw her bigoted ways and changed. BJudy never did.\n\nWho were they going to send into Little Rodentia ?\n\nThe smallest mammal on the ZPD shown in the movie aside from Judy and Nick was Wolfard. But even he would have a difficult time in the little town. Judy barely pushed the buildings back. McHorn would likely have damaged the infrastructure. Who knows if there are sewer lines and other tunnels under that part of town.\n\nSo not only is Judy the best possible option as she's small, but it was also key for her to go in unarmed.\n\nA net gun spreads, so missing would do more harm than good. Smaller citizens may be injured in the crossfire, and that's not even getting into if it hits a building. A taser or dart gun would be ineffective. Not only would you be trying to hit a wet noodle, but whether you hit or miss, there would be a lot of damage done.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCVT66oUyTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCVT66oUyTM)\n\nIf Judy were to hit her target, he may die. Weaselton's body is smaller and thinner, the projectile has a higher chance to pierce vital organs: arteries, lungs, kidneys, etc. A taser has piercing barbs. So for the safest possibility for both the criminal and smaller citizens, you'd need to take down Duke unarmed in this scenario.\n\nSending a rhino into Little Rodentia to capture a small mammal is reckless endangerment. Sending Judy is the safest option you've got here.\n\nJudy running her mouth off at a mob is from her being new to the city.\n\nThey did infiltrate the asylum. If they didn't and just called for backup on the wolves, then that's calling on mere suspicion with no evidence. Who was to say that the wolves outside had anything to do with the kidnapping of Manchas? They had wolves on film doing it, but who says it was them?\n\nThey were standing around and guarding the premises like a private security firm. Lionheart would have heard about it and they would then need a warrant for a search. That process could take longer than Judy had time for. Going by the fact that they were wolves is just profiling.\n\nThen there was Judy opting to get the evidence to Bogo. If you didn't see who was there, and who wasn't there, then here's what went wrong. Clawhauser wasn't working at the reception desk, he was moved down to records. This may seem like something to brush off, but sheep showed up at the museum. Conspiring sheep cops, specifically.\n\n**\\[5\\] Closing remarks**\n\nBorba's said several times to \"separate the artist from their works\".\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/850203330/4862856953](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/850203330/4862856953)\n\nHowever, nobody is going to separate anyone from their attitude or how they interact and respond to people. Not in the past, not in recent events, not in the future.\n\nHere's a bit of an interesting historical fact. The word \"Goodbye\", etymologically comes from a contraction of the phrase \"God be with you\" written originally as \"Godbwye\".\n\n[https://www.etymonline.com/word/good-bye](https://www.etymonline.com/word/good-bye)\n\nHere, he shows that he doesn't want people to forget:\n\n[https://www.deviantart.com/borba/journal/Never-Say-Goodbye-875557656](https://www.deviantart.com/borba/journal/Never-Say-Goodbye-875557656)\n\nSo, here's the imgur link:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/IvzB8iq](https://imgur.com/a/IvzB8iq)\n\nIf any of the links below are edited or deleted, you'll know why.\n\nAnd word of advice. If someone tells you who they are, then get the evidence to support it. If someone shows their true colors, don't try to repaint them.\n\nThis quote seems best suited here:\n\n\u201cOne of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we've been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We're no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It's simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we've been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back. So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new ones rise.\u201d\n\n\u2015 **Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark**\n\nThank you to all those that helped in this post.

          "selftext": "Killian Hayes is now averaging 5.9 PPG shooting 29% from the field in 25.5MPG. \n\n(Here is his basketball reference link: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hayeski01.html)\n\nNeedless to say, those are horrible numbers, and the eye test is not helping either,  he really does not look good. \n\nA player who underachieves as a high first round pick is not really unusual, it happens a fair amount, but let's look at his background first.\n\nKillian Hayes played for Ulm in Germany, and they were one of the worst teams in Eurocup, which is the second tier European competition behind Euroleague. Now players from European teams usually get selected as high first round picks in the NBA when they have incredible potential and/or play well in the Euroleague. Interestingly, Killian did not check either box.\n\nKillian averaged about 12 PPG on good shooting percentages in Eurocup, but then again he was playing for the worst team in Eurocup that season. Which means Hayes had decent numbers on the worst team of a second tier tournament in Europe.\n\nKristaps Porzingis also played in Eurocup with Sevilla, but had massive potential with his incredible physical features. The Spanish league is also one of the best in Europe. \n\nAlperen Sengun also played in the Eurocup with Besiktas, but he was the MVP of the Turkish League as an 18 year old who is 6\u201910 tall. The Turkish League is also one of the best leagues in Europe (better than Germany at least). He was selected as the 16th pick, so that sounds like a well thought out and justified draft pick.\n\nSo, I basically have no idea how the Pistons landed on selecting Killian Hayes as a 7th pick in the first round. He was never exceptionally good in any aspects of basketball, but he was above average at shooting and handling the ball in Eurocup. This type of player profile should be a 25th-40th pick in the draft, in my opinion.\n\nWhat do you guys think the Pistons saw in Hayes, and how do you think Hayes will develop in the NBA?",

          "selftext": "I hope this doesn\u2019t offend anyone, but someone please help me understand what\u2019s going on with millennial parents. \n\nI\u2019ll preface this by saying my 14 month old is vaccinated according to the AAP/CDC\u2019s schedule, my husband and I are fully vaccinated and boosted against covid, we are both healthcare providers, AND I sometimes use essential oils and try to use products with minimal toxins. \n\nSo I\u2019m not trying to shame anyone for using essential oils or products with cleaner ingredients. But I am so genuinely confused and disturbed by my fellow millennial parents who seem to have all these bizarre anti medicine, anti science beliefs. \n\nMy brother and sister in law have become these people since the pandemic started. They went from asking what vaccines they needed in order to see our baby IF covid was settled by her due date (it obviously wasn\u2019t lol) to being pregnant themselves and suddenly against all conventional medical recommendations. They believe that babies are surrounded by toxins in the womb and so they won\u2019t do the gestational diabetes test bc the drink has artificial dyes. They believe ultrasounds are a toxin, my sister in law will not be getting vaccinated for covid, flu and TDAP, their baby will not be vaccinated bc they believe vaccines cause autism, SIDs, are toxic, etc., they\u2019re planning on having a home birth to avoid the epidural, Pitocin, etc. \n\nThey refuse to listen to doctors but will gladly listen to the recommendations \u201cholistic mama\u201d gives on Instagram (with no medical expertise) as she shills essential oils and supplements that aren\u2019t regulated. \n\nMy brother in law shared a post about reducing fevers in babies without medicine, including chiropractic adjustments, egg yolk baths, skin to skin\u2026 \n\nThe most disturbing part is I know a lot of people like this who also happen to be highly educated. I worry the pandemic has turned so many people into anti vaxxers/ anti medicine and we are all going to suffer for it.",

          "selftext": "Spouse and I have been working on our intimacy - it changed drastically after I gave birth to kiddo. We\u2019re working on establishing a new normal, and we have since introduced new activities, one of which is hand jobs. We are in our 30s, but we\u2019ve discovered ways to make them extremely enjoyable for both of us (multiple orgasms for him, new turn ons for me, etc.).\n\nSpouse had to go out of town for work and was leaving on Thursday, so I thought I\u2019d give him a fond farewell/good night\u2019s sleep on Wed. However, I didn\u2019t anticipate being as turned on as I was while playing with him, so we immediately escalated to full on fucking (as in, thrust it in as hard as you can because that feels amazing right.now.) for 35 minutes.\n\nI have a little difficulty climaxing (which wasn\u2019t the case BC - before child), but if I feel it, I get into a rhythm and rock really hard both on top and bottom, which greatly stresses my glutes, hamstrings, and calves. At one point about 20 minutes in, I was close but then developed a charley horse in my calf, which is a MAJOR buzzkill. However, after the extreme pain passed, I still wanted a big finish, because again, intimacy and togetherness and horny. Cue an additional 15ish minutes of working for it.\n\nSadly, I didn\u2019t finish the natural way, but we have alternatives that come into play (spouse is very open about toys, and it definitely helps keep the bedroom spicy) so that I at least got something good. The whole session was defined as pig fucking because we were rolling around just going at it like animals, and we were crazy sweaty afterwards.\n\nThursday, my legs are sore. I mean, aching when I walk and sore when I go to sit down and stand up. This is nothing out of the ordinary; as the frequency of our sessions has decreased, the fitness related to that has also diminished. Yay, spouse and I fucked so hard I\u2019m walking funny - we\u2019ve all heard that joke.\n\nFriday morning, after I take kiddo to school, I\u2019m work and feel an urge to pee (not uncommon, I suffer from tiny bladder syndrome). I go, it feels a little uncomfortable, but nothing alarming. About 45 minutes later, I feel the need to go again, and this time it burns a bit. Ugh, might be a UTI. Alright, more fluids, keep an eye on things. Next pee is 30 min later\u2026 and when I look after wiping, it\u2019s red. I know it\u2019s not my period because Aunt Flo made her usual hit-and-run visit the week prior. Ok, a little panicked now.\n\nThe day progresses and I feel worse and worse down there. It feels like a UTI (though no fever or chills), and I collected a sample - it looked like old black tea. New sense of panic sets in - I\u2019m now thinking that I\u2019m peeing blood, and spouse is out of town for 4 days, what do I do. I am thankfully blessed with good health insurance, but as this discovery was made after the doctor\u2019s office closed, I\u2019m at the mercy of the on-call doc. Thank whatever deity you acknowledge that my PCP was on call this weekend. Because she knew my history, I didn\u2019t have to go to the ER for a urine analysis, and she just prescribed me some antibiotics. She was not as worried about the discoloration of my urine as I was, but I guess that\u2019s why she went to med school.\n\nSo this morning, I get up to go to the bathroom and it doesn\u2019t hurt to pee. There\u2019s no discoloration. It\u2019s not even cloudy. (Yes, I\u2019m sure you wanted to know all about my urinary health.) Now I\u2019m thinking \u201cwhat the actual fuck\u201d - I hadn\u2019t even started taking the antibiotics and I was already better.\n\nBefore I called my doctor\u2019s office, called my BFF, who is also a doctor. She talked about how there are lots of reasons why there may appear to be blood in the urine, one of which is rhabdomyolysis \u2013 it\u2019s a condition in which extreme muscle breakdown leads to increased myoglobin in the bloodstream, which is then filtered out by the kidneys and then excreted. Because myoglobin is what makes red blood cells red, this can give the appearance of blood in the urine.\n\nI start adding up the pieces. My sore muscles, the charley horse I experienced during sex, the delayed change in my urine\u2026 all of this points to rhabdomyolysis and not a UTI. I have an appointment with my PCP on Monday, so I\u2019ll be able to do an actual urine test to confirm this, but given the fact that I have taken zero antibiotics and that my discomfort is practically gone, it\u2019s pretty safe to say that my spouse and I fucked me into rhabdo.\n\nTL;DR: Had aggressively physical sex with my spouse; two days later I develop rhabdo from the excess strain on my muscles (but not before thinking that I\u2019m really sick).",

Tried to go back to the angel room, but exited game to save the game to avoid lost progress and the angel room despawned despite having not entered it, nor exited the boss room. Not actually sure if that room despawn might be another bug too?\n\nBoth crashes were when flipping from Live Laz to Dead Laz after picking up the item. Not sure if that has any relevance.\n\nDid quick test on the item room crash. It didn't matter how long I waited to flip. First time was immediately after picking up the item. Second time I gave it a few seconds and still crashed. Third time I went in as Dead Laz and was able to pick up the item and flip without crashing.",
